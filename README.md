# colorMix

It is a color-picker app from Intro to App Development with Swift Book. It was an excerxice on Lesson 17 Actions and Outlets from the book.

## What I have learned
I learn to use Interface Builder to lay out UI elements. I learn how to connect app's interface to Swift code by connecting Actions and Outlets in the app. I learn to change app's display from Swift code. I learn to use switchs, sliders and button in colorMix app.
